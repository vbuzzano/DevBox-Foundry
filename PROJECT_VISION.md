# DevBox - Project Vision

## The Problem

RetroComputing development on systems like Amiga OS is a **high-friction experience**:
- Documentation scattered across decades-old resources
- Cross-compilation toolchains are complex to setup
- No centralized package management (like modern systems)
- Time investment before writing first line of code is **demotivating**

Result? Many would-be developers never start.

## The Solution

**DevBox** removes friction by providing:
- **One-command setup** for complete development environments
- Pre-configured, tested toolchains (VBCC, NDK, etc.)
- Scalable architecture for multiple platforms/systems
- Modern workflow on retro platforms

Get coding in minutes, not hours.

## Vision

Build a **simple, modular system** that makes retro-computing development *accessible* again.

Start with Amiga OS. Expand to other platforms if demand exists.

## Note

This is a **learning project** — no pretensions. Born from personal need to simplify setup and learn PowerShell deeply. May reinvent existing wheels. Future: possibly rewrite in Python.

Goal: **Make retro-dev *easy* again.**
